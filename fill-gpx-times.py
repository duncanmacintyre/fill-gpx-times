"""
fill-gpx-times.py â€” Fill in missing GPX timestamps by interpolation.

This script reads a GPX file and fills in missing timestamps for track points by
interpolating between the nearest known timestamps. Interpolation is done based on
the distances along the track (distance-weighted interpolation).

If the script encounters non-monotonic times (a point with a time not strictly later
than the previous one), it discards the bad time and instead uses the next strictly
later good time as the future anchor for interpolation.

The script ensures that all assigned times are strictly increasing. If needed, it will
add microsecond adjustments to break ties.

Dependencies:
    - Python 3.8+
    - gpxpy

Installation:
    pip install gpxpy

    or with conda:
